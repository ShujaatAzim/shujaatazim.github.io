    `I've been a full-stack developer since 2019, but my journey here has been anything but straight. 
    I've worked across different fields, including medicine, finance, and tech — each one taught me 
    something different about problem-solving, learning, and staying adaptable. I'm genuinely grateful for those 
    experiences because they shape how I approach challenges every day as a developer. I bring curiosity, resilience, 
    and a constant drive to keep growing, both in my career and personally.`,
